<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Processing markdown rules**

I've got to remember the markdown rule: using bold to highlight key information. I should also present the URL clearly. Before calling the tool, I need to include a status update sentence or two. There's no need for a to-do list here since it's a straightforward task. I want to keep the code output minimal, focusing on presenting the link effectively. Okay, let's run the command!</details></think>

我先检查该仓库的 Git 远程配置来获取 GitHub 地址。接着我会把结果直接告诉你。

---

```bash
cd "/Users/jinchen/Downloads/xiaojinpro-gateway/services/xjp-auth-center-sdk" && git remote -v | cat
```

```
origin	https://github.com/rickyjim626/xjp-oidc.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/rickyjim626/xjp-oidc.git (push)

```

- **GitHub 仓库地址**: `https://github.com/rickyjim626/xjp-oidc`

如果你需要我打开该链接或查看最近的提交、分支等信息，告诉我即可。
